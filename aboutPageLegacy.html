            <p>CITIZEN WATCH is a true manufacture d'horlogerie with a comprehensive manufacturing process that extends
              from creating a watch's individual components to its final assembly. The company operates in more than 140
              countries and regions around the world. Since its founding in 1918, CITIZEN have held the belief of
              “Better Starts Now” — that is, no matter who you are and what you do, it is always possible to make
              something better, and now is the time to start doing it. Sharing this belief, we have made watches,
              invented and improved technologies and explored the future of watches such as our proprietary
              light-powered Eco-Drive technology and state-of-the-art satellite-synchronized timekeeping</p>

                <p>There is a strong parallel between the evolution of fashion and the watches that Tissot has been
                  creating for women since 1853. In the 19th century, Tissot pendant watches were often richly
                  decorated. Tissot counted famous women among its clients, like the French actress Sarah Bernhardt, who
                  bought an exquisite pendant watch when visiting the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1900.
                  From the early 20th Century, Tissot also created wristwatches, well before the inter-war years and the
                  heyday of this new type of watch.
                  In the 1940s and 1950s, through its wide range of models for all tastes, ages and occasions (for
                  sport, for work or perfect for the evening), the brand spoke particularly to the ‘woman of today’.
